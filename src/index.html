        VP, Technology Services Lead | <span class="fw-bold">Bank of America</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently work as a senior full stack engineer inside the Security Operations 
          division of the bank.  My primary function is designing and coding microservice 
          APIs in C# and Python for machine learning and data sciences applications and 
          writing websites for reporting in ReactJS.  I maintain and enhance a large Python 
          project for managing backups taken from financial centers and writing to tape 
          libraries.  Earlier in my career I did work on a website analytics site in PHP 
          and a database inventory API in Python/Flask and ReactJS.

          This role I architected and coded APIs in C#.  I was a senior engineer

          with an entry level startup that folded as quickly as I joined. It's a funny
